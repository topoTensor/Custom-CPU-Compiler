# Custom CPU Compiler

A lightweight experimental compiler written in Python for my custom-built Verilog CPU.  
This project is a **work in progress** and subject to major redesigns as the CPU and instruction set architecture (ISA) evolve.

## Project Goals

The first version of the language aims to support:

- Integer types  
- Arithmetic and bitwise operations  
- Control flow: `if`, `else if`, `else`, and `while`  
- Function definitions and calls  

Support for I/O, arrays, and strings is currently **not planned**, since implementing features like `print()` would require simulating an operating system or at least a virtual machine â€” which is beyond the current scope of this CPU.

## Implementation Checklist

### Language Features
- [ ] Integer types
- [ ] Arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)
- [ ] Bitwise operations (&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>)
- [ ] Control flow statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`, `while`)
- [ ] Functions (definition and calls)
- [ ] Basic error handling (syntax and semantic errors)

### Compiler Components
- [x] Lexer
- [ ] Parser
- [ ] Semantic analyzer
- [ ] Code generator (to custom ISA)
- [ ] Optimizer

### Future Extensions
- [ ] Support for arrays
- [ ] Support for strings
- [ ] Basic I/O functions
- [ ] Virtual machine simulation
- [ ] Standard library functions

## Example Syntax

```ruby
# Comments start with a hashtag.
a = 10
b = 12
c = a + b  # Other operations: -, *, /, &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>

if (a < b) {
  # do something.
} else if (a > b) {
  # branching
} else {
  # do something else
}

i = 0
while (i < 10) {
  i = i + 1
}

function add(a, b) {
  return a + b
}
